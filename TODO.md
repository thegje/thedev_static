## Rules 
1 - Before proceeding with a new backlog item, ask for an explicit 'yes please' to proceed 
2 - After completing a task, ask if it's been completed correctly before moving on. 
3 - If the task has been completed successfully, mark the backlog item as complete, prepend the date, and commit the changes. After committing the changes add the commit hash to that backlog item, format it like so: "- [x] DD/MM/YYYY - 11:49 - Example backlog item text - commit: 1234567890"
